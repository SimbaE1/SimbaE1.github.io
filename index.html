                <p><strong>TL;DR ‚Äî Who's SimbaE11?</strong></p>
                <p>SimbaE11 is an 11-year-old code/musician who finishes more side-quests than most adults start. He's shipped browser bots, home-grown GPTs, a Pi-day memory game, a Mac surveillance suite, and even a cryptanalysis toolkit‚Äîall before middle school graduation. When he's not deploying code, you'll find him practicing flute and violin, performing sleight-of-hand, or drawing inspiration from Mahler's Tragic Symphony No. 6 for his next grand idea.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Flute is harder than violin. Down bow spicatto is easy - I just don't take enough time to learn it as the violin is also quite boring due to the lack of difficulty. Everything about flute is harder.</p>
