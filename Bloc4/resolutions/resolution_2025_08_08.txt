The Social, Cultural, & Humanitarian Committee

Noting the consequential impact of the current justice system,

Having examined the harms that unjust, corrupted systems can bring to the majority of all populations, including developing and developed nations unanimously,

Understanding the need for a better system of pre-trial detention,

Observing the high amount of countries with laws or expectations in place that do not follow them, 

Acknowledging the millions of people being assassinated or murdered in prisons every year, according to a UN report in 2016
Almost ⅔ of our prison population being that of pre-trial detentions
The very little resources being spent into restorative justice and rehabilitation systems concern,

Emphasizing the rights of each individual,

Observing the lack of enforcement of laws regarding prisons,

Observing article 9 of the ICCPR, which states that the default solution for those awaiting trial should not be pre-trial detention,

Remembering the millions of casualties that are being produced by unjust Justice Systems globally per year; 









Requests for nations leading in restorative justice systems, such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Scandinavian countries, to share their resources and input toward developing nations in need of a new justice system;
Noting restorative justice as a priority until the year 2050 to make sure all countries have implemented the law
During this process, countries will be ensured to keep their cultural and humane traditions 
Allows unlimited support for nations around the world toward the UN to train their staff to encourage restorative justice programs
Providing the funding that is being invested in unjust systems toward developing NGOs such as Goodwill and Red Cross that are invested in providing rehabilitative systems,

Calls Upon countries to enforce the already established Nelson Mandela Rules;
Requests Countries that have high income to support others
Those who successfully implement a more efficient solution both morally and money-wise may be called upon 

Trusts all to find cheaper, and more morally ethical pre-trial alternatives - Philippines
A method for low-risk crimes could be electrically monitored, which costs around an order of magnitude less, and allows those awaiting their trials to be free.
Have those with middle offense crimes be put in house arrest
Those who commit murders or other high-risk crimes may be put in pre-trial detention, however the country is encouraged to improve the living situation

Encourages the shipping of new PPE every week, having weekly screenings for prisoners, and supports having weekly lessons on how to keep hygiene
 Shipments of PPE supported by prisoner budget
 prison screenings are mandatory with a fine if a prisoner misses one
 if a prisoner has a disease, they will be placed in a quarantine cell that is suitable and may help them recover,
 c.  lessons to be taught by volunteers and representatives from the Penal Reform NGO

Mandating the general assembly to allocate a set budget on international prison funding, including specifics such as:
Distributing the money among countries, distributed based off of net worth, prison system, and money going into prisons. Certain countries can get bonuses in this funding if determined by the general assembly,
Give all countries the funding necessary to meet the requirements described in clause 11,

Encourages the use of smaller state-level committees to review non-hostile crimes to increase efficiency and decrease the number of prisoners in pre-trial detention,
In alignment of our restorative justice 

Further requests all nations in the United Nations to increase funding and provide support toward rehabilitative systems that go toward H.E.A.L., with New Zealand as a leading example,

Reemphasizes the need for country participation in supplying prisoners with masks and other hygienic materials in the event of a pandemic using previously stated funding, 

Expresses hope for renewable treaties that further encourage the usage of the almost hundred-fold of reports and expressions that are in action by the United Nations and its Committees today;

Supports the creation of new ways of rehabilitation programs
Programs to be run by volunteers of the Prison Fellowship Academy NGO,
Those who show success in programs could have their sentence reduced depending on the level of the crime,
Programs will be supervised by UNODC, SOCHUM, UNGA,
Declares a minimal set of requirements for prisons to meet in terms of space, hygiene, education, and other necessary facilities;
Any and all prison cells must be at least 6*7*8 square feet per prisoner,
A judge, however, can excuse a prison from this mandate,
A prisoner must be given the option to receive an education based off of the job market of the location of the prison, the most important academic subjects, and a passion of the prisoners choice,
The most common types of jobs (e.g. agriculture in farming focused areas) will be taught to all prisoners. Each prisoner will take 1-3 academic courses, and they may pick a passion,
A judge can revoke the prisoners right to learn a passion, or can change the passion,

Emphasizes the creation of new prisons for the countries who haven't upgraded in 50+ years;
Make old prisons tourist attractions, funds go to building new prisons, 
Also funds to be provided by the Party For Prison event where celebrities and artists come together to raise money,

Defining the sets of crimes,
A Low-Risk crime is:
The damage does not exceed $10000
The crime is defined as a ‘misdemeanour’ by country law
The crime is not harmful or dangerous to all humans
A Mid-Risk crime is:
The damage in the price range of $10,000 - 100,000
The crime is defined as a felony or lower (but not misdemeanour)
The crime is harmful, but not dangerous to all humans
A High-Risk crime is: 
The damage exceeds $100,000
The crime is defined as malice aforethought 
The crime is harmful and dangerous to all humans

Fixes issues in the longer run- by focusing more on fixing the behaviors than making sure criminals, both victims and offenders are more satisfied with the outcome. Studies also suggest that restorative justice also leads to decreasing reoffending rates from participants,
Victim Satisfaction;
2023 survey shows that 84% of people participating in restorative justice conferences would suggest to others according to the Ministry of Justice,
79% of subjects were satisfied with res. Justice conferences they participated in and were also happy with the overall process,
Repeat offenders A 2008 study shows that criminals who participated in res. Justice conferences reoffended 23% less than other criminals that did not participate over the next 12 months;
Continue to emphasize the need for global cooperation and international trade to ensure the better usage and demonstration of restorative justice and prison reformation.
